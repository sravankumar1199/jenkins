######## jenkins #########
jenkins is a CICD methodology
# CI means continuous integration # CD means continuous Delivery or Deploy
1.continuous integration is a devops software development
2. where developers regularty merge their code changes into a central repository, like github, bigbuket 
3.the key goals of continuous integration are to find the bugs,improve software quality,and reduce the time to validate and release new software upda
4. artifact means out changes code is ready to merge

## jenkins
1. jenkisn is open source project,written in java that runs windows,linux,mocos
2.consist of plugins..In jenkins has lot of plugins that uses for test or build
3.It was developed by sun microsystem
4.whenever developers write code,we integrate all the code and at any point of time we build,test and delivery or deploy to client.this is called CI/CD.

## jenkins is standead on application means ui,backend,db ##
in jenkins db means filesystem

## integration of git with jenkins Topic ## 
1. means what project is in git repo that will execute in jenkins


## In jenkins how to configar git code to jenkins ##
1.first create a job select freestyle and create again select source code management paste git url link in repo
2.next branches to build  why */ it means all files selected in git repo and select # currrent which brancher are in github that select in jenkins brarch

## In jenkins what we configar inside the jenkins ##
1. That configar stores in this path /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/job-3

## Freestyle disadvantages ## UI, can not restore easily, can not trace who did changes 
for example: we created job-3 in freestyle and we configar someting inside the job-3, so not secure that job easliy someone can enter into our created job-3 so they do something inside the job-3, that is not secure 
That's why pipeline feather came #

##### MASTER-AGENT ARCHITECTURE #####
For example: if you have 2acres formland you do your work youself or you have 200acres you will distribute work load to employers
so same: jenkinsmaster also provides work load to agents 
                            agent-1
         jenkinsmaster      agent-2
                            agent-3

###### How to connect jenkins to Agent-1 #####
1. First launch instance in aws name: Agent-1
2. open Agent-1 in superputty with ippubile & install java use # yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk 
3.open jenkins ,manage jenkins,nodejs,new repo,node name AGENT-1,select permanent agent,
4.number of executors = 3 means how many jobs run at a time use give like 1 to many more jobs
5.remote root directory = /home/centos 
6.lables = AGENT-01
7.Launch method = 2option , first option means agent can ask work to jenkins second option jenkins can ask work to agent 
8.host means agent private ip paste 
9.add cendentials username: centos password: DevOps321 add and again select
10.host key verification strategy = non verification strategy
11. save and launch agent 
12. create job in jenkins select freestyle,select restrict and give name: AGENT-2 and press excute shell : echo "THIS IS AGENT-2"
echo "THIS IS FORM JENKINS MASTER TO AGENT" >/tmp/sunny.txt
13. apply and save and build
14.again open agent-2 sever in superputty open tmp folder and cat sunny.txt appears in what we written in execute shell in jenkins

## How to download and install jenkins in jenkins server ##
1.launch instance in aws name: jenkins
2.search in google : jenkins
[a] sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
[b] sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
[c] yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk
[d] yum install jenkins
[e] start and enable jenkins

echo "THIS IS AGENT-2"
echo "THIS IS FORM JENKINS MASTER TO AGENT" >/tmp/sunny.txt
